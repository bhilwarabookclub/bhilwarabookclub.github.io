The Housekeeper and the Professor by Yoko Ogawa really got the BBC going today ! 

A kind and patient housekeeper; a genius and warm professor; a curious and caring boy. Add 3 of them together, multiply with plenty of math formulas, divided by limitations of space (mostly in the cottage) and time (80 minute memory), minus the Japanese reflection is what this story is ! ðŸ˜ƒ

Some of us liked the book perhaps for it s sweet message via mathematics. For others it just didn't seem to have a purpose. Few of us delved into the philosophy between the numbers whereas few others questioned mathematics in itself. 

Ogawa s translated book seems like a math puzzle to be solved. Perhaps after many attempts, it will bring some sort of satisfaction. 

Math lovers - relish the prose. 
Math critics - wallow in the confusion.

Only a smart bunch like us can make even the shortest and simplest reads into a 2 hour long discussion! ðŸ˜„
