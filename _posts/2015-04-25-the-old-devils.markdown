And then there were three...

The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld is disturbing.

After 10 year old Jas’ brother dies, the 3 siblings along with their father and mother go through such tremendous grief as a family at a Dutch dairy farm. Tragedy can bring a family together or break them - in this case it broke them slowly and miserably.

Jas goes through sexual experiments, animal violence and even self torture - any lengths to just feel a glimpse of happiness or love from her parents. 

The author dumps us right in the muck of it all with all her graphic descriptions of each and every observation by a girl entering puberty and very deep in grief. 

It is definitely not an easy read and for some the ending left us with relief and for others even more worry. 

How does such an uneasy read make it to the International Booker Prize ? 

Perhaps the unique experience a reader goes through by the power of words determines the deserving award.

Definitely not a book to recommend to just anybody, this book manages to creep under your skin yet leave you in awe with it s rawness .

Marieke Lucas still works on a dairy farm and her first attempt at writing a novel clearly shows that there are still so many stories to be told and so many stories to be heard in this world.

Perhaps the deliberate attempt to stay in the present throughout the whole book served as a loophole for the other characters. Were the parents always so distant ? Did the siblings always use sexual and animal violence to resort to play ? 

Rishabh, Shruti and I enjoyed our chat especially after a long time. Would like to hear others’ views on this book even if only a few pages were read.
