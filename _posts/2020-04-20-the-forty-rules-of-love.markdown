Elif Shafak s 'The Forty Rules of Love' had parallel stories running at different time and place. Rumi - Shams and Ella - Aziz. But did they both truly mirror each other ?

Rumi, Shams and a bunch of other interesting characters from the 13th century had so much depth and were so well written  about. Back to the modern world, Ella, Aziz and all other people in her life weren't given so much details and here lay the flaw. 

Some of us empathized with Ella but others didn't feel like her reason was strong enough to define her actions. 

A unique style of novel within a novel, deeply spiritual and short chapters made this a good read. Many of her forty rules of love resonated with us. Although we started on a journey with Ella but ended up having fond memories of Rumi and Shams.
