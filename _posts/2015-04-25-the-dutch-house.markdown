The Dutch House by Ann Patchett is a beauty in it s style, slow rhythm and the gorgeous cover. Danny and Maeve made us all reflect our own sibling love. So many characters with simple relationships but all very deep, layered and fragile. 

Motherhood, fatherhood, sisterhood, brotherhood; all roles come with responsibilities and scrutiny under the microscope. Should choices be made for love for others or oneself ? 

We discussed all and perhaps still have thoughts in our minds as we left the meet. Well done Ann Patchett ! ðŸ˜Š
