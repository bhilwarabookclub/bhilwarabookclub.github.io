Although we were few , many thoughts, ideas and feelings were shared about The Chosen. The theme was really liked but perhaps a bit bogged down by the history and Judaism details. 

A different read with father son relationship, bonding of friendship, the power of silence and a peak into a different community of people. 

On a personal note, this book still means so much to me today as it did many years ago. ðŸ’™
