What a happy discussion filled with laughter ! And one would think that a book narrated by Death during Nazi occupation would result in plenty of macabre and sombre talks. ðŸ˜Š

It was a beautiful (-ly written) book where themes like the power of words (compared to the power of silence in The Chosen - each equally sound), the kindness and cruelty of humans, the dualities of Nazi - era Germany and the survivor s guilt put together a truly  amazing read. Tell and not so much show is Markus' style. Perhaps Death is a 'she' who is vulnerable, not all evil and can carry all the burden of mortality with her. Plan to drop a postcard to Mr. Zusak on behalf of BBC to find out.
