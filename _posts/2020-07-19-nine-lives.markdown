Not 'Wow' book but definitely not a 'Not Wow' conversation ! ðŸ˜ƒ

Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India by William Dalrymple was BBC s first tryst with nonfiction. 
9 folktales about extreme religious/spiritual practises of ordinary people from around India (one based in Pakistan). All interesting, eye-opening (for those who never knew) and purposeful stories that shed light on the non-touristy corners of the country by a travel historian/journalist/curator. All of them shared a common theme of belief and determination in their faith as the only way of life. Dalrymple chose to lay down all the cards on the table for us and provided us with the facts of his interaction/interview with each one. For some this method seemed a smart move, for others it drove them away from it all. 

Should the author have put in his insights and feelings for us to also feel for these 9 people ? What we took away from this book - the concept of self-interpretation of any relgion, spiritual path or faith - is not newfound knowledge. Perhaps that s why this book didn't receive as much appreciation as it could have...from us.
