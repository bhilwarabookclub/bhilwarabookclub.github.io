Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie s book 'Half of a Yellow Sun' is a story from Nigeria during the Biafran war. Just as a war is confusing, complex, many-things- going-on, detailed, never- ending and above all not required... So are some of the tough-to-remember-named characters, various plot details and the length of this book. 

More impressed were we by the author and her ideas as a voice for Nigeria. We listened to her Ted Talk 'The Danger of a Single Story'. Perhaps that s what she tried to do through this book. But at some point it was 'lost in translation'.
