The Lost Girls of Paris by Pam Jenoff received an almost unanimous reaction from all of us - lack of depth in all the 3 characters. Eventhough the book is a fast read, page turner, many-stars-reviewed and has an enticing title, it couldn't fool us (If i may say). Historical fiction that was a bit too far fetched and therefore didn't do any justice to the true women spies of WWII. They perhaps deserve a better story teller. 

Although brought down to a quick train-journey read, this book did shine light on these heroic and brave women. More adventure and less romance would have substantiated their existence more. Sometimes we need a mediocre piece of literature to appreciate the best ones. This is the price this book has had to pay.
