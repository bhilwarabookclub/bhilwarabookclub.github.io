Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari  had trouble leading up to it s hype and recommendation.   

In order to tackle the history of humankind, which he terms as sapiens, he also explains the history of agriculture, happiness, money, colonization,  animal cruelty, social systems, religions, language, and so much more.  

This superfluous book with so much information had it s bright moments but many times slowed the reader down.  

There was also an argument that his  theories and conclusions were baseless. A work of nonfiction cannot be so oversimplified that the facts are just brushed upon.  

For some this simplified tale or story telling of humans from the start to now was a delight. The pieces tied in together and reasoning gave way to clear moments.
