We all agreed to have really liked the book. In fact we started liking it even more as we discussed it. We talked about it s many themes including the irrationality of racism, the power of female community, the parallel to bees, and the importance of storytelling. Forgiveness and motherhood came up many times as well. Truly a good read with so much to take away by Sue Monk Kidd.
