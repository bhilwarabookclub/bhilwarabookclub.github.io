Forest of Enchantments by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. So much to say for a story that wasn't new to anyone of us ! We kept comparing the Ramayan with this Sitayan - couldn't help it since most of us have been brought up with this  epic. Sita s views, thoughts and feelings definitely came across well in this book but certain parts felt rushed. Enjoyed the lively conversations. 
For those of you who missed it, feel free to share your thoughts on the group regarding the FoE.
