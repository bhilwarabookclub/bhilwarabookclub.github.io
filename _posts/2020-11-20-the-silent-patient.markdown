The Silent Patient has met the 'hype' it has reiceved for a debut novel. Most of us enjoyed the psychological thrill but some of us cynics found Alex Michaelides very typical of the Hollywood screenwriter that he is. 

Being a fiction, Alex took many liberties of exaggerating the relationship between a therapist and a patient. Was it because he had a 'silent' main character and didnt know how to move the story forward ? Or he just wanted it to hit high on the Times Best Seller List ? 

We delved into the psyches of both Alicia and Theo. Multiple timelines were revealed later. Twists and turns made us want to race with the pace and get to the end. Reference to an old Greek tragedy made us sit-up and look-up. Curiousity made this book a fast read. Once in a while to enjoy a story for what it is, is fun !

Not an amazing piece of literature but a well produced project. The author s background in English literature, Psychotherapy, Greek ethnicity and Hollywood screenwriting was displayed in this carefully thought-out story. Perhaps appealing to some. 

Silence is used in many ways by women. As a defence mechanism, as a message, shock response, guilt, revenge and sometimes to organize thoughts and feelings that leads to a calm conclusion.

Soon to be a Hollywood movie produced by and perhaps starring Brad Pitt. Cant wait to see if it will live up to the 'hype' of the book.
