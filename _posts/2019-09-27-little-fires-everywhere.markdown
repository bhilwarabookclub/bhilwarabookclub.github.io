Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng was liked but not necessarily loved by all. Multiple characters ranging from 4 different mothers varying in background and  personilites to 5 teenagers doing what 'normal' teenagers do including teenage angst. The twists and turns in the story explored themes of identity, following rules, racism and relationships. The thoughts and ideas we shared was filled with personal emotions and experiences from our own past. The beauty of a book club ! ðŸ˜„
