A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty  Smith was so loved by Anjani Auntie that she translated it in Marathi for her mother and mother in law. A 'Labor of Love' in a literal sense and we all felt the beauty and charm it s simplicity when we read it too. This book resonates with all regardless of time and place. 

Reality of poverty; realist vs. Idealist parenting; keeping education on a high pedestal; perseverance through hardship - especially the women made of invisible steel; following the American Dream; Tree of Heaven - the apt metaphor. Many such themes discussed.
