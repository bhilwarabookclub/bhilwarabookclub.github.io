Oh, what an evening discussing My Cousin Rachel by Daphne de Maurier ! All of us wanted answers. Did Rachel murder Ambrose ? Did Rachel love Ambrose ? Did Philip murder Rachel ? Was Rachel plotting all this time ?
Going around and around in circles... but we LOVED it. Ha ! Just when you thought women were predictable. 

A page turner and such mystery and enigma around Rachel made this book stay with us long after we 've read it....for some of us, it s still a mystery after 40 years ! Daphne de Maurier s style is so very cool and kept us all hooked.

Murder, mystery, romance, drama, tragedy....no wonder so many film and tv adaptations have been made. But none do justice to this masterpiece of literature. 

All those questions in our minds is precisely what Daphne de Maurier wanted us to experience. 
'Oh Daphne, our torment'
